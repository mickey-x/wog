# **Building a Wog Web App**

This project is part of the SOEN 341 - Software Process class at Concordia University.

## **The Task**

In a no team of student, implement an application (Instagram) using any programming language/ scripting language, frameworks, or any other tools of choice. All members of your team must have a good understanding of the tools used. Your documentation, both internal and external, must be clear enough to be easily understandable by a reader who may not be familiar with the language or tools used.

The completed application will have 4 features. Three will be provided by the instructor, the 4th feature will be decided by students.

## **The Goal Of This Project**

- Learn modern web development based on agile principles.
- Work efficiently as a team by taking advantage of the latest tools & technologies available.
- Complete a functional web application in a limited time frame.

## **Core Features**

- Be able to post a picture with description.
- Be able to follow an user.
- Be able to leave comment & like a post.

## **Team Members**

- Mickey Mulat
- Dawit Amene
## **Technologies Used**

### **> Programming language**

[Modern JavaScript](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript#:~:text=ECMAScript%20(or%20ES)%20is%20a,pages%20across%20different%20Web%20browsers.>) / `ECMA Script 6+` will be used in this project as the main programming language.

### **> Framework**

We chose to build our web app with `React` framework along with `Material UI`. See the [Getting Started](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) guide. Quick start guide on how to [create a new React app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html).

For Material UI, please visit [this website](https://material-ui.com/) to learn more.

### **> Database**

We are planning to choose [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) to host images, posts and other data in our app.

### **> Other Tools**

#### `npm`

> `npm` is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language.

[Read on Wikipedia](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Npm_(software)>) or see the **Tutorials** section below.

#### `NodeJS`

> Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.

[Read on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js) or view a short explanation video in the **Tutorials** section.
